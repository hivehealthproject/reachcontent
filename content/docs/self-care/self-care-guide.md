# Self-Care Guide

## Overview

Self-care is the practice of taking an active role in protecting one's own well-being and happiness, particularly during periods of stress. It's looking into what is draining your energy and figuring out what you can do to fill it back up to function optimally.

Self-care is not about getting a weekly spa day, putting yourself first in every single situation, or forcing yourself into a gym routine you hate. It's actually much simpler - it's looking into what is draining your energy, and figuring out what you can do to fill it back up to function optimally.

## Why Self-Care is Important

### Benefits of Self-Care

**It's good for you:**
Chronic stress, and often burnout, is the biggest threat to anyone's overall health. In small doses, stress can push you to improve and be productive. However, studies have linked chronic stress to inflammation which can lead to heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders, and a weakened immune system.

**It feels good:**
Taking care of yourself and your needs feels good. Taking breaks from work or getting a good night's sleep may drastically improve your day. It can also:
- Boost your immunity
- Improve focus and cognitive ability
- Regulate your emotions
- Increase your energy levels

## Signs You Need More Self-Care

Have you ever experienced any of the following?

- **Being on autopilot**: Days feel like a blur where you just go through the motions rather than completing tasks with purpose, joy or enthusiasm
- **Strain in relationships**: When exhausted, you may become less patient, more irritable and have less energy for social activities
- **Putting others first all the time**: Once you put so much energy into supporting others, you may have nothing left for yourself
- **Eating less healthy meals**: Choosing "comfort" foods or "easy-to-make meals" over healthy options
- **Constantly trying to catch up**: Feeling like you're always failing, always running late
- **Mind swings between haze and chaos**: Some days feel like brain fog, others like racing thoughts
- **Physical exhaustion**: Headaches, stomach aches, muscle tension, lower energy levels

## Types of Self-Care

### 1. Emotional Self-Care

A large part of day-to-day happiness is the ability to manage and cope with difficult emotions. By checking in with yourself and allowing space to feel and manage emotions with healthy coping mechanisms, you improve your sense of well-being.

**Activities to try:**
- Journaling
- Reaching out to a friend to talk

### 3. Mental Self-Care

- Saying no to plans when you need rest
- Taking a day away from your phone
- Sending a message to a friend you haven't seen

### 5. Spiritual Self-Care

This type of self-care is about connecting with what nurtures your soul, whether you are religious or not.

**Activities to try:**
- Spending time in nature
- Understanding your values and acting in line with them
- Volunteering for a cause you care about
- Meditating
- Engaging in prayer or attending worship services

### 6. Professional Self-Care

If you are currently working, professional self-care helps avoid feeling overwhelmed and burnt-out.
