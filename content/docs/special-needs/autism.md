# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

## Overview

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD may communicate, interact, behave, and learn in ways that are different from most other people.

The term "spectrum" refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity. Some people with ASD may need a lot of support in their daily lives while others may need less.

## Causes

The exact cause of Autism and other ASDs is still not known. Research indicates that the etiology is likely to be multifactorial with a strong genetic basis.

However, non-genetic factors may also play a role:
- Parental age
- Maternal nutritional and metabolic status
- Infection during pregnancy
- Prenatal stress
- Exposure to certain toxins, heavy metals, or drugs

## Treatment

ASDs are lifelong chronic conditions. At present, there is no cure for the core symptoms of autism. However, several approaches can help:

### Behavioral Interventions
Research has shown that the most effective therapy is early intensive behavioral interventions that aim to improve functioning. These focus on:
- Developing language
- Social responsiveness
- Imitation skills
- Appropriate behaviors

### Medication
Several groups of medications, including atypical neuroleptics, have been used to treat associated behavioral problems such as aggression and self-injurious behaviors.

### Key Principles
- Behavioral techniques should begin early in the preschool period
- Followed by highly individualized educational intervention in school
- Family involvement is crucial
