# Learning Difficulties

## Overview

Learning difficulties (also called learning disabilities or learning disorders) are a group of disorders that affect the brain's ability to receive, process, analyze, or store information. These problems can make it difficult for a student to learn as quickly as others.

Learning difficulties are not indicative of intelligence. People with learning difficulties are often of average or above-average intelligence.

## Causes

Experts say that there is no single, specific cause for learning disabilities. However, there are some factors that could contribute:

- **Heredity**: Learning disabilities can run in families
- **Illness during and after birth**: Illness or injury during or after birth, drug or alcohol consumption during pregnancy, physical trauma, poor growth in the uterus, low birth weight, premature or prolonged labor
- **Stress during infancy**: A stressful incident such as high fever, head injury, or poor nutrition
- **Environment**: Increased exposure to toxins such as lead
- **Comorbidity**: Children with learning disabilities are at higher risk for attention problems or behavioral disorders. Up to 25% of children with reading disorders also have ADHD

## Intervention and Support

With timely intervention and support, children with learning disabilities can be successful in school. Early detection helps children benefit from treatment or therapy.

### Educational Support
- **Individualized Education Program (IEP)**: A personalized and written education plan including goals, services, and specialists
- **Modifications and accommodations**: Adjustments that allow kids to learn the same material in different ways
- Being involved in general education while getting extra support

### Therapy
Depending on the learning disorder, some children may benefit from:
- **Speech therapy**: For language disabilities
- **Occupational therapy**: To improve motor skills for writing problems
- **Alternative therapies**: Music, art, and dance can benefit children with learning disabilities

### Acceptance
It's important to let kids with learning disabilities be themselves, accepted fully for who they are, without always trying to "fix" them. Allow them to pursue things that interest them.
