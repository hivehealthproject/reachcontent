# Immunization

## Overview

Vaccines can prevent infectious diseases that once killed or harmed many infants, children, and adults. Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, preventing millions of deaths each year.

Without vaccines, children are at risk for getting seriously ill and suffering pain, disability, and even death from diseases like measles and whooping cough.

## How Vaccines Work

Vaccines help your body's immune system recognize and fight specific pathogens (germs). They contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism that triggers an immune response within the body.

After vaccination, if you encounter the actual pathogen, your immune system is prepared to:
- Recognize the invader
- Produce antibodies quickly
- Fight off the disease

## Vaccine Safety

### Risks and Benefits

The main risks associated with getting vaccines are side effects, which are almost always:
- Mild (redness and swelling at the injection site)
- Temporary (go away within a few days)

Serious side effects after vaccination, such as a severe allergic reaction, are very rare. Doctors and clinic staff are trained to deal with them.

**The disease-prevention benefits of getting vaccines are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children.**

### Exceptions

The only exceptions are cases in which a child has:
- A serious chronic medical condition like cancer
- A disease that weakens the immune system
- Had a severe allergic reaction to a previous vaccine dose

## Why Vaccines Start Early

The recommended schedule protects infants and children by providing immunity early in life, before they come into contact with life-threatening diseases.

Children receive immunization early because:
- They are susceptible to diseases at a young age
- The consequences of these diseases can be very serious, even life-threatening, for infants and young children
- Early vaccination provides protection during the most vulnerable period
