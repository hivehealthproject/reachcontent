## FAQs

### How much sleep do I really need?

The answer varies considerably across age groups and from person to person. For most adults, 7 to 8 hours a night appears to be the best amount of sleep. However, infants generally require about 16 hours of sleep per day, while teenagers need about 9.

### What happens if I don't get enough sleep?

The cumulative effects of sleep deprivation are broad yet potentially serious. Experts believe that sleep is necessary for our nervous systems to work properly. Too little sleep leaves us drowsy and unable to concentrate.
