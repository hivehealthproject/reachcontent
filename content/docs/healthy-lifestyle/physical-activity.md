## FAQs

### Why should I exercise?

There are a number of reasons, both short-term and long-term, to engage in physical activity. In the short term, physical activity can help reduce feelings of depression and anxiety, control weight, and promote psychological well-being. In the long term, physically active people have a lower risk of dying prematurely and of developing diseases like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and colon cancer. It also helps to build healthy bones, muscles, and joints to prevent injuries.

### Is one kind of aerobic activity better for weight loss than others?

Yes and no. Generally speaking, activities that require you to carry your own weight, such as walking or stair climbing, use more calories than those that support your weight for you, like biking. However, the most important part of weight loss is just doing something. So if you can't stand walking, but you love to bike, then biking is your answer because it's far better than doing nothing at all. You may just have to do a little longer to burn the same amount of calories. Choose something you enjoy and will be motivated to do regularly.

### How can I include more physical activity in my daily life?

- If you have a desk job, use your coffee breaks to take five- to 10-minute walks
- In parking lots, park your car as far away as you can
- Use a pedometer to count how many steps you take each day
- Increase your daily step count by 1,000 steps each week until you reach 10,000 steps a day
- Take the stairs instead of the elevator whenever possible
