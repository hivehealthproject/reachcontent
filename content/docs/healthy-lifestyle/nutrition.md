## FAQs

### What is Food Addiction?

Food addiction is a disease that causes someone to lose control of being able to stop eating certain kinds of food. With food addiction, the body develops chemical dependencies on certain foods, which causes them to overeat these foods, even if they logically know it will have negative consequences.

### Why does weight loss seem to be harder as you age?

As people age, their hormones change, which causes their metabolic rate to change. As men lose testosterone and women lose estrogen, their metabolism slows, making the weight easier to put on and harder to take off.

### Is vegetarian (or keto, or any specific diet) the best way to eat?

There's not one best way to eat. We are all different, and it would be impossible to choose one plan that would be right for everyone. The best plan for you is the one that meets your medical and nutritional needs while also being affordable, accessible, enjoyable and something you can stick with for the long term. Seeing a dietitian can help you figure out what works best for you.
