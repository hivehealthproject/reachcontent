## Types of Violence

### Dating Violence

Dating violence is when a partner engages in physical, sexual, psychological, social, and digital violent behavior. The goal is to dominate, control and exert power over the victim.

Dating violence can be seen in romantic relationships where dating has just begun in youth. During this period, the young person who encounters violence may not be able to talk to anyone and feel alone, as flirting is seen as a 'secret', 'shameful', 'must hide' topic.

**Warning Signs:**
- Controlling behavior
- Jealousy and possessiveness
- Putting you down
- Isolating you from friends and family
- Physical aggression
- Pressuring you sexually

### Stalking

Stalking is being constantly watched and followed by a person you broke up with, a person you don't want to be with, or a person you are currently with. Stalking aims to arouse fear, intimidate, and make someone feel insecure.

**Examples of stalking include:**
- An ex coming to your home or school without being invited
- Appearing in front of you in places you go
- Constantly sending gifts or flowers
- Communicating with your circle of friends to get information about you
