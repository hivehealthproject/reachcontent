# Air Quality

## Overview

Air quality significantly impacts human health. Both outdoor and indoor air pollution can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems and are linked to various diseases. Understanding air quality and taking protective measures is important for maintaining good health.

## Air Quality Index (AQI)

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become.

**AQI Values:**
- **0-50 (Good)**: Air quality is satisfactory
- **51-100 (Moderate)**: Acceptable; may be a concern for sensitive individuals
- **101-150 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups)**: Sensitive groups may experience health effects
- **151-200 (Unhealthy)**: Everyone may begin to experience health effects
- **201-300 (Very Unhealthy)**: Health alert; everyone may experience more serious effects
- **301+ (Hazardous)**: Health emergency; entire population likely affected

## Health Effects of Air Pollution

Air pollution can cause:

### Short-Term Effects
- Irritation of eyes, nose, and throat
- Coughing and wheezing
- Shortness of breath
- Worsening of asthma and allergies

### Long-Term Effects
- Respiratory diseases
- Heart disease
- Stroke
- Lung cancer
- Reduced life expectancy

## Who is Most at Risk?

Two groups are at higher risk from air pollution:

### More Susceptible Individuals
People with an increased response to exposure due to:
- Pre-existing conditions (cardiorespiratory diseases)
- Genetic factors

### More Vulnerable Individuals
People with increased exposure due to:
- Place of residence
- Type of occupation
- Internal factors (children have increased ventilation rates)

**High-Risk Categories:**
- People with pre-existing conditions (e.g., cardiorespiratory)
- Children
- Pregnant women
- Elderly
- Outdoor workers

## Protection Measures

### When Air Quality is Poor
- Limit outdoor activities
- Stay indoors when possible
- Keep windows closed
- Use air purifiers if available
- Wear masks rated for pollution (N95 or similar)

### General Measures
- Monitor local air quality
- Plan outdoor activities when air quality is better
- Create clean air spaces at home
- Support policies that reduce air pollution

## FAQs

### What does AQI mean?

AQI stands for Air Quality Index. An AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to the national air quality standard for the pollutant, which is the level set to protect public health. AQI values below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is considered to be unhealthy - at first for certain vulnerable groups, then for everyone as values get higher.

### Should people remain indoors during a major air pollution episode?

Avoiding air pollution through staying indoors may be beneficial but the effect largely depends on the level of indoor exposure. There are many potential sources of indoor air pollution, such as cooking, smoking, and infiltration from outdoors. The effectiveness of staying indoors depends on factors like type of ventilation and building characteristics.

### Who is more at risk of air pollution?

Two groups are at higher risk:

1. **More susceptible people** have an increased response to exposure due to pre-existing conditions or genetic predisposition.

2. **More vulnerable people** have increased exposure due to external factors (place of residence, occupation) or internal factors (children have increased ventilation).

Categories at higher risk include:
- People with pre-existing conditions
- Children and pregnant women
- Elderly
- Outdoor workers
