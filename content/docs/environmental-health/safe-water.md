## Making Water Safe

Treating drinking water for safe use is one of the greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century.

### Multi-Barrier Approach

Providing clean, safe drinking water requires:
1. Protecting source waters from contamination
2. Appropriately filtering and treating "raw water"
3. Ensuring safe distribution of treated water to consumers' taps

### Home Water Treatment

When municipal water treatment is not available or reliable:
- **Boiling**: Bring water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute
- **Filtration**: Use appropriate water filters
- **Chemical treatment**: Chlorine tablets or drops
- **UV treatment**: Ultraviolet light purification
