# Climate Change

## Overview

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While some of these shifts may be natural, since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

Climate change has significant implications for human health, affecting air quality, water safety, food security, and the spread of diseases.

## Global Warming vs. Climate Change

The terms "global warming" and "climate change" are sometimes used interchangeably, but global warming is just one of the ways in which climate is affected by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases.

**Global Warming:** The recent rise in the global average temperature near the earth's surface, caused mostly by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere from human activities such as burning fossil fuels.

**Climate Change:** Broader changes in climate patterns, including precipitation, wind patterns, and extreme weather events.

## Health Impacts

Climate change affects people's health in numerous ways:

### Air Quality
- Atmospheric warming can increase ground-level ozone in many regions
- Can cause bronchitis, asthma, and worsen lung function

### Infectious Diseases
- Expected to expose more people to ticks that carry Lyme disease
- Increased exposure to mosquitoes that transmit West Nile and other viruses

### Food and Nutrition
- Rising temperatures and extreme weather can disrupt food availability
- Affects food safety and nutritional quality

### Water Security
- Changes in precipitation patterns
- Increased risk of floods and droughts

### Extreme Weather Events
- More frequent and severe heat waves
- Increased flooding and storms
- Wildfires

## Reducing Risks

People can reduce the risks of climate change by:

### Individual Actions
- Making choices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions
- Using public transportation or walking/cycling
- Reducing energy consumption
- Eating less meat
- Reducing waste

### Community Actions
- Identifying and reducing vulnerabilities
- Considering climate change risks in planning and development
- Protecting vulnerable populations (children, elderly, those in poverty)

## FAQs

### What is the difference between global warming and climate change?

The terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but global warming is just one of the ways in which climate is affected by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. "Global warming" describes the recent rise in the global average temperature near the earth's surface, caused mostly by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases from human activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy.

### How does climate change affect people's health?

- **Air quality**: Atmospheric warming can increase ground-level ozone, causing bronchitis and asthma
- **Infectious diseases**: Climate change exposes more people to disease-carrying ticks and mosquitoes
- **Food**: Rising temperatures can disrupt food availability, safety, and nutritional quality

### How can people reduce the risks of climate change?

People can reduce the risks by making choices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and by preparing for expected changes. Communities can identify and reduce vulnerabilities and consider climate change risks in planning. Such actions can ensure that the most vulnerable populations are protected from health and safety threats.

### What are the benefits of taking action now?

The longer people wait to act on climate change, the more damaging its effects will become on the planet and people's health. If people fail to take action soon, more drastic and costly measures to prevent greenhouse gases from exceeding dangerous levels could be needed later.
