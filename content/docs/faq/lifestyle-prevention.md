## Nutrition

### What is Food Addiction?

Food addiction is a disease that causes someone to lose control of being able to stop eating certain kinds of food. With food addiction, the body develops chemical dependencies on certain foods, which causes them to overeat these foods, even if they logically know it will have negative consequences.

### Why does weight loss seem to be harder as you age?

As people age, their hormones change, which causes their metabolic rate to change. As men lose testosterone and women lose estrogen, their metabolism slows, making the weight easier to put on and harder to take off.

### Is vegetarian (or keto, or Mediterranean diet) the best way to eat?

**There's not one best way to eat.** We are all different, and it would be impossible to choose one plan that would be right for everyone.

The best plan for you is one that:
- Meets your medical and nutritional needs
- Is affordable
- Is accessible
- Is enjoyable
- Is something you can stick with for the long term

Sometimes that may not be clear, but seeing a dietitian can help you figure it out.

## Sleep

### How much sleep do I really need?

The answer varies considerably across age groups—and from person to person.

| Age Group | Recommended Sleep |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Infants | About 16 hours per day |
| Teenagers | About 9 hours |
| Most adults | 7 to 8 hours a night |

### What happens if I don't get enough sleep?

The cumulative effects of sleep deprivation are broad yet potentially serious. Experts believe that sleep is necessary for our nervous systems to work properly.

**Consequences of too little sleep:**

**Sleep disorders like sleep apnea have been linked to:**
- Depression

## Personal Hygiene

### Why is personal hygiene important?

Good hygiene is vital because it helps prevent you and your children from getting or spreading germs and infectious diseases. The germs that cause many diseases can be passed on through:
- Touching other people
- Getting feces (poo) on your hands
- Handling contaminated food
- Coming into contact with dirty surfaces or objects

**Conditions from poor personal hygiene include:**
- COVID-19 and other infectious diseases
- Diarrhea
- Respiratory infections, including colds and flu
- Staph infections
- Worm-related conditions, such as threadworms
- Trachoma, an eye infection which can lead to blindness
- Tinea or athlete's foot
- Tooth decay

### How do I wash my hands?

To avoid getting sick, wash your hands properly for **at least 20 seconds**:

1. Wet your hands with water
2. Apply enough soap to cover all surfaces of your hands
3. Rub your palms together
4. Clean between the fingers and the back of your hands
5. Clean dirty nails with a scrubbing brush, if one is available
6. Rinse both sides of your hands, preferably under clean running water
7. Dry off your hands with a clean towel
8. Use the towel to turn off the tap

You can also use hand sanitiser if water and soap are not available. Make sure you rub the palms, backs of the hands and in between your fingers.

## Immunization

### What are the risks and benefits of vaccines?

Vaccines can prevent infectious diseases that once killed or harmed many infants, children, and adults. Without vaccines, your child is at risk for getting seriously ill and suffering pain, disability, and even death from diseases like measles and whooping cough.

**Risks:**
- The main risks are side effects, which are almost always mild (redness and swelling at the injection site) and go away within a few days
- Serious side effects, such as a severe allergic reaction, are very rare
- Doctors and clinic staff are trained to deal with them

**The disease-prevention benefits of getting vaccines are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children.**

Exceptions are cases where a child has:
- A serious chronic medical condition like cancer
- A disease that weakens the immune system
- A severe allergic reaction to a previous vaccine dose

### Why do vaccines start early?

The recommended schedule protects infants and children by providing immunity early in life, before they come into contact with life-threatening diseases. Children receive immunization early because they are susceptible to diseases at a young age. The consequences of these diseases can be very serious, even life-threatening, for infants and young children.

## Substance Use Prevention

### Why is tobacco highly addictive?

Smoking is an addiction. Tobacco products contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical found naturally in tobacco plants.

Nicotine addiction has two components: **physical and psychological**. Research suggests that children and teens may be especially sensitive to nicotine, making it easier for them to become addicted. The younger the smoker, the more likely he or she is to become addicted.

### What are the factors influencing substance use and abuse?

- Family history of addiction
- Mental health disorder
- Peer pressure
- Lack of family involvement
- Early use
- Taking a highly addictive drug

### What are the risks related to substance use?

Different drugs cause different health problems. Drug use can lead to:
- Dependence and addiction
- Injury and accidents
- Health problems
- Sleep issues
- And more

### How does substance use affect the brain?

After repeated drug use, the brain starts to adjust to the surges of dopamine. Neurons may begin to reduce the number of dopamine receptors or simply make less dopamine. The result is less dopamine signaling in the brain—like turning down the volume on the dopamine signal.

## Sun Protection

### What are the two types of sun protection?

There are two different types of sunscreen: **chemical and physical**.

**Chemical sunscreens** use up to a dozen ingredients that, when applied, are absorbed in the top layer of skin. They react with the skin to absorb UV rays and convert them into energy before they can harm the skin.

### Does the sun have UV rays?

Too much ultraviolet radiation (UV) from sunlight is dangerous. Nearly half of UV radiation is received between **10 a.m. and 4 p.m.**, when the sun's rays are the strongest. Even on a cloudy day, you can be affected by UV radiation.

### Can UV rays cause cancer?

Most skin cancers are a result of excessive exposure to the UV rays in sunlight. Both basal cell and squamous cell cancers (the most common types of skin cancer) tend to be found on sun-exposed parts of the body, and their occurrence is typically related to lifetime sun exposure in high amounts.
