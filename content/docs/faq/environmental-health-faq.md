# Environmental Health FAQs

Common questions about climate change, air quality, water safety, and land quality.

## Climate Change

### What is the difference between global warming and climate change?

The terms "global warming" and "climate change" are sometimes used interchangeably, but global warming is just one of the ways in which climate is affected by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases.

**Global warming** describes the recent rise in the global average temperature near the earth's surface, which is caused mostly by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere from human activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy.

### How does climate change affect people's health?

- **Respiratory issues:** Atmospheric warming has the potential to increase ground-level ozone in many regions, which can cause multiple health issues (e.g., bronchitis and asthma) and worsen lung function
- **Vector-borne diseases:** Climate change is expected to expose more people to ticks that carry Lyme disease or other bacterial and viral agents, and to mosquitoes that transmit West Nile and other viruses
- **Food security:** Rising temperatures and extreme weather have the potential to disrupt the availability, safety, and nutritional quality of food

### How can people reduce the risks of climate change?

People can reduce the risks of climate change by:
- Making choices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions
- Preparing for the changes expected in the future

Decisions that people make today will shape the world for decades and even centuries to come.

**Communities can prepare by:**
- Identifying and reducing their vulnerabilities
- Considering climate change risks in planning and development
- Ensuring that the most vulnerable populations—such as young children, older adults, and people living in poverty—are protected from the health and safety threats of climate change

### What are the benefits of taking action now?

The longer people wait to act on climate change, the more damaging its effects will become on the planet and people's health. If people fail to take action soon, more drastic and costly measures to prevent greenhouse gases from exceeding dangerous levels could be needed later.

## Air Quality

### What does AQI mean?

AQI stands for **Air Quality Index**. An AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to the national air quality standard for the pollutant, which is the level EPA has set to protect public health.

| AQI Value | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Below 100 | Generally satisfactory |
| Above 100 | Unhealthy—at first for vulnerable groups, then for everyone as values get higher |

### Should people remain indoors during a major air pollution episode?

Avoiding air pollution through staying indoors may be beneficial but the effect largely depends on the level of indoor exposure.

**Potential sources of indoor air pollution include:**
- Cooking
- Active and passive smoking
- Infiltration of air pollutants from outdoors to indoors (depends on type of ventilation, building characteristics, etc.)

### Who is more at risk of air pollution?

Two groups of people are at a higher risk from air pollution than the general population:

**More susceptible people** have an increased response to exposure to air pollution due to innate or acquired predisposition, such as pre-existing conditions or diseases.

**More vulnerable people** have increased exposure due to external factors (place of residence, type of occupation) or internal factors (increased ventilation in children).

**Categories generally considered more at risk:**
- People with pre-existing conditions (e.g., cardiorespiratory)
- Children & Pregnant women
- Elderly
- Outdoor workers

## Water Safety

### Where does drinking water come from?

Drinking water comes from many sources:
- **Most common:** Surface waters such as rivers, streams, and lakes; ground water sources such as aquifers and springs
- **Less common:** Captured rainwater, snow-melt, and desalinated seawater

### How do germs and chemicals get into drinking water?

There can be many sources of contamination of our water systems. The most common sources of contaminants include:
- Naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (e.g., arsenic, radon, uranium)
- Local land use practices (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, livestock, concentrated animal feeding operations)
- Manufacturing processes
- Sewer overflows
- Malfunctioning wastewater treatment systems (e.g., nearby septic systems)

### What type of health issues can be related to water quality?

Contaminants in our water can lead to health issues, including:
- Gastrointestinal infections
- Reproductive problems
- Neurological disorders

**Populations at increased risk:**
- Infants
- Young children
- Pregnant women
- The elderly
- People with weakened immune systems

For example, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children.

### How do you make drinking water safe?

Treating drinking water for safe use is one of the greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century. Providing clean, safe drinking water requires a **"multi-barrier approach"** that includes:
1. Protecting source waters from contamination
2. Appropriately filtering and treating "raw water"
3. Ensuring safe distribution of treated water to consumers' taps

## Land Quality

### What is the difference between desertification and land degradation?

The difference between land degradation and desertification is geographic.

**Land degradation** is a general term used to describe a negative trend in land conditions caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes. Degradation can be identified by the long-term reduction or loss in:
- Biological productivity
- Ecological integrity
- Value to humans

**Desertification** is land degradation when it occurs in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas. Desertification is also not limited to irreversible forms of land degradation.

### What causes contamination in the ground and why should we clean it up?

Contamination of land can arise as a result of:
- Past poorly regulated industrial and waste disposal activities carried out with little regard for the environment
- Illegal dumping
- Accidental spillage of substances
- Natural causes (in some instances)

**Common contaminants include:**
- Oils and fuels
- Domestic and industrial waste
- Heavy metals
- Solvents

Where contamination is found to be significant, it needs to be cleaned up to minimize the harm it could cause to people and the environment in general.

### How long does it take to determine if land is contaminated and carry out remedial works?

It is difficult to predict how long it will take to determine a site and to carry out any remedial works as this is likely to vary from site to site.

Based on a number of sites that have been investigated throughout the country, time scales have varied from approximately **one to five years**, with some sites being investigated over longer periods before a decision is reached on whether or not it requires remediation (clean up).
