## Primary Care & Family Medicine

### When Should We Go To A Family Health Center?

Family Health Centers offer basic primary healthcare services, including preventive healthcare, diagnostics, treatment and rehabilitation services, to individuals. These services are very common and easily accessible by individuals.

Primary healthcare services are the go-to services when we need to consult a professional about anything related to our health, **except for emergencies**. If necessary, family physicians may refer you to another professional or hospital.

### Which Services Are Offered Under Primary Healthcare Services?

In Turkey, primary healthcare services are mainly offered by Family Health Centers. Family healthcare services cover all preventive healthcare services and primary healthcare services offered to registered individuals without any discrimination of age, gender or health condition.

Community health centers also offer primary healthcare services. Unlike family health centers which offer services to individuals, community health centers offer services to the whole community. The objective is to improve and protect the health of the local community.

### Who Are Covered By Family Health Services? How Do You Register For A Family Physician?

In the scope of family health services, every individual is matched with a family physician to:
- Regularly monitor and evaluate their health condition
- Address and manage the patient-physician relationship on the basis of mutual trust
- Have a physician who has sufficient information about the health history of the individual

**Registration process:**
- During the first implementation of the system, family physicians were automatically appointed by the Ministry according to residence address
- Individuals were given a right to choose a different physician
- Newborns, babies and children who are not yet registered in a birth registry are registered with the same family physicians as their mothers
- Individuals can choose their family physicians **without geographical restriction**

**Important notes:**
- Family physicians cannot be changed earlier than 3 months, unless it is mandatory
- A family physician can be matched with not more than 4000 people
- You can find out your family physician by using the search function on **e-Devlet/e-Nabız** application or by consulting the nearest Family Health Center or the Community Health Center/District Directorate of Healthcare in your district

## Guest Patient System

### What Is The Guest Patient System?

Individuals who will be away from their permanent residence address or who will temporarily live in Turkey can access healthcare services from the nearest family physician under the guest patient system.

When a person needs to access healthcare services at a different location than their permanent address during:
- Summer holidays
- Travels
- Any other reason

These services can be offered by a family physician in that city as a "guest patient".

**Note:** The districts governed by the Law on Metropolitan Municipalities are considered as a single region in the implementation of the guest patient system. In this region, healthcare services cannot be offered under the guest patient system. Individuals in this region are asked to first consult their own family physician except for emergency situations.

## Migrant Health Services

### What Is Migrant Health Center?

Migrant Health Centers (GSM) are established under community health centers at locations with higher migrant populations to:
- Offer preventive healthcare services to forced migrants in a more effective and efficient way
- Overcome the problems arising from language barrier
- Improve access to healthcare services

**Enhanced GSMs** are established in:
- Temporary accommodation centers that are away from a fully-equipped public hospital
- Residential areas with a migrant population over 20,000 people

**Enhanced GSM services include:**
- Primary healthcare services
- Internal medicine
- Pediatric care
- Obstetrics-gynecology
- Oral and dental health
- Psychosocial support services
- Imaging units

The aim is to improve access to services and reduce the workload of hospitals.

## Health Literacy

### Why is health literacy important?

Health literacy is important because the more you can understand about your health and health care, the healthier you can be. Improving your health literacy is one of the cheapest, easiest, and most effective ways of improving your health.

**Key facts:**
- Health literacy is more likely to predict a person's health correctly than age, income, employment, education level, and race (Journal of the American Medical Association)
- Those with low health literacy are less likely to use screening and prevention services, take medications as directed, and find their way through the health care system

### What are examples of situations that require health literacy?

Good health literacy helps in almost every health care situation:
- Choosing a cold medicine at the pharmacy
- Being able to read at-home post-surgery instructions
- Discussing your symptoms with your doctor or care provider

### What does it mean for a patient to take an active role in their healthcare?

As a patient, it is important to take an active role in your health care because you are your own best advocate.

**Important points:**
- You should never feel bad to speak up, ask questions, and seek answers about your health or the health of a family member in your care
- Your health care is a team effort, of which you are an important part
