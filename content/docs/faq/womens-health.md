## Contraception

### What are contraceptive methods?

**Hormonal Methods:**

**Birth control pills** regulate the hormone balance to stop the ovulation process. It is one of the most popular contraceptive methods.

**Intrauterine devices (IUD)** - Also known as spiral, is a T-shaped plastic apparatus that is inserted in the uterine. It may contain hormones or be copper-coated.

**Contraceptive injection** - An alternative method for women who often forget to take their birth control pills or do not prefer other birth control methods. It is one of the most popular methods due to its convenient use and long-term protection.

**Implants** contain hormonal drugs that are slowly released into the ovaries, thus preventing pregnancy for up to 3 years. They are administered under the skin for once.

**Birth control patches** contain progesterone and estrogen that affect ovarian functions. It is a beige coloured patch that is 3-4 cm wide, and very easy to use. Birth control patches can be worn on the chest, arms, legs, stomach or back.

**Morning-after pill** is not a birth control method, but merely a quick remedy for unexpected situations. When taken after unprotected sexual intercourse, the pill releases high levels of hormones to change the structure of the uterus and prevent ovulation and fertilization. It may be effective if taken within up to 72 hours after sexual intercourse, but the effect is at maximum level in the first 12 hours.

**Barrier Methods:**

**Preservative (Condom)** - In addition to birth control, condoms offer protection against sexually transmitted diseases, which make them the top choice for many people.

**Diaphragm** - It is a dome-shaped bowl made of rubber (latex) that sits over the cervix. Diaphragm is an easy-to-use and reusable method, and it's a popular device among women who do not prefer hormone pills.

**Spermicides** - Substances that kill the sperms entering the vagina. They can be in the form of suppositories, foams or creams. They can offer increased protection when combined with other contraceptive methods.

**Surgical Methods:**

**Tubal Sterilization (Having Tubes Tied)** - A simple and quick laparoscopic procedure in which the surgeon ties the tubes of the patient. Couples should think carefully before choosing this method because reversing it can be difficult and expensive.

**Vasectomy** - A procedure in which the seminal ducts of a man are tied.

## Menstrual Health

### What is menstrual irregularity?

Menstruation is the monthly shedding of the lining of a woman's uterus if pregnancy has not occurred. This process is supposed to occur as a cycle from puberty to menopause. Women's menstruation cycle is paused during pregnancy and early breast-feeding period.

Normally, the interval between two menstruation cycles is about **21 to 35 days**. If this interval is shorter or longer or if the menstruation stops abnormally, it means that person suffers from menstrual irregularity.

- Young women who do heavy exercises can also have the same problem
- Women who just reached puberty or are in their menopausal ages may have the same problem due to fluctuation
- Intervals can be longer among women who have hormonal disorders such as diabetes or thyroid

**Reasons for shorter intervals between menstruation cycles:**
- Stress may disrupt the hormonal balance in our body
- Infections or sexually transmitted diseases (may emerge with symptoms including vaginal secretion, itch, burning sensation during urination)
