## Urology & Kidney Health

### What is testicular torsion?

Each testicle hangs from a seminal duct in the scrotum. These ducts contain blood vessels that carry blood to the testicles. If the testicle rotates on the seminal duct, the blood cannot reach the testicle. This condition may occur without any reason or due to heavy physical activity.

**Symptoms:**
- Sudden and often severe pain in one testicle
- A testicle that is positioned higher than normal in the scrotum
- Nausea and vomiting
- Light-headedness
- Swelling of the scrotum
- Fever
- Abrupt and severe pain in a testicle, particularly after sudden or heavy physical activity

### What is cystitis?

Cystitis is the inflammation of the bladder. It is one of the most common diseases of the urinary tract and reproductive system. If not treated immediately, it may spread and affect the kidneys and lead to permanent damage in the bladder and kidneys.

### How can we protect our kidney health?

- Kidneys need lots of fluids to function properly. Fluid intake must be increased in hot and dry weather. You should drink at least 2 liters of water per day.
- You should not hold your bladder for a long time.
- You should protect your kidneys and urinary tract against cold.
- You should not take drugs without consulting a healthcare professional.
- If you feel pain or ache when urinating, or observe blood or discharge in your urine, you should immediately go to a healthcare facility.

## Specialized Treatments

### What is hyperbaric oxygen therapy?

Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is a method in which the patient, sitting in a sealed cabinet, breathes pure oxygen under pressure that is higher than the sea level. It is an evidence-based therapy with efficacy scientifically proven in multiple studies. The therapy is given in pressurized rooms that can host one or more people at the same time, using masks, hoods or endotracheal intubation (tubes inserted into the windpipe), depending on the clinical table and needs of the patient. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be used to treat a variety of diseases, including sudden hearing loss, sudden vision loss, bone infection, bone death, diabetic foot ulcers.

### What is the decompression sickness (bends)?

Decompression sickness, which is also known as the bends, is a disease among scuba-divers. Also, the Caisson Disease is also a type of decompression sickness that is common among workers exposed to compressed air tunnels.

The disease occurs when nitrogen in the breathing air solution dissolves due to increasing pressure at depths of water, and quickly turns into bubbles in the arteries and tissues as the gas cannot be quickly discarded from the blood as the person rises back to the surface of the water. These bubbles may lead to various symptoms and findings depending on their location in the body.

### How can we avoid heater poisoning?

The first thing you should be careful about is the quality of the stove and the fuel. Fuel for heating should be manufactured according to applicable standards, and it must be bought from duly authorized sellers. It is crucial to have proper chimney ventilation and the maintenance of the chimney must be done regularly. You should not light the stove before going to bed, and you should put out the fire in the stove before sleeping. The stove must stand 10 cm above the floor. Do not put too much fuel into the stove.

## Orthopedics & Sports Medicine

### How does cartilage injury heal?

Mild injuries of the cartilage tissue may be self-healing. Modest and severe injuries are treated with therapies or surgical procedures by physicians.

### What is the VO2 Max test?

In VO2 Max, "V" stands for "volume", "O2" stands for "oxygen", and "max" stands for "maximum". Therefore, the term "VO2 Max" refers to the highest oxygen volume that can be used by the body during exercise. This is an important value because, in general, it shows the fitness level of an individual and helps plan workout programs for a healthier body.

### What is scoliosis?

Scoliosis is characterized by sideways curvature of the spine and it is a very common orthopedic problem. Affected individuals may have difficulties in their daily lives due to restriction of the ability to move and various symptoms of the disease. Treatment of the disease can be planned according to the severity and symptoms. It is very difficult to correct scoliosis without proper treatment, which includes physical therapy, scoliosis exercises and surgical procedures.

### What is the most common cause of knee and hip pain?

Knee and hip pain may emerge with or without trauma. The most common reason is arthrosis, or calcification of the hip and knee, which results from damage in the cartilage tissues. Firstly, the severity of the condition must be understood. Treatment methods may vary depending on the severity, including surgical and non-surgical methods.

## Burns & First Aid

### What should be done in case of a burn?

**First aid for thermal burns:**
1. If the person is still on fire, they must stop panicking and running
2. Cover the patient with a blanket and ask them to roll on the ground
3. Analyze vital signs (ABC)
4. Remove clothes without lifting the skin in the burnt area
5. Keep the affected area under running water for at least 20 minutes (not recommended if the area is too large)
6. Remove accessories like rings, bracelets, watches as edema may form
7. Cut clothes if they get caught
8. Be careful about hygiene
9. Avoid bursting blisters
10. Do not apply drugs or ointments
11. Cover with a clean piece of cloth
12. Seek medical assistance (112)

**First aid for chemical burns:**
1. Sever contact between skin and chemical immediately
2. Wash affected area gently for 15-20 minutes under unpressurized water
3. Remove clothes
4. Cover the patient
5. Seek medical assistance (112)

**First aid for electrical burns:**

### What is First Aid?

First aid refers to any drug-free application performed with available tools and instruments, without requiring specialized medical instruments, which is offered on the scene of an accident or any life-threatening incident to save someone's life or to avoid deterioration of someone's health condition until medical response by a healthcare professional is available.

### What is CPR?

CPR is the first aid technique that is used to resuscitate a person in the event of a cardiopulmonary arrest or asphyxiation. CPR stands for "cardiopulmonary resuscitation", in which the term "cardio" refers to the heart, and "pulmonary" refers to the lungs.

As a rule of thumb, the brain is not damaged during the first four minutes, therefore it is highly probable that CPR can be life-saving without any permanent brain damage if it is performed in the first four minutes. Brain damage starts between 4th and 10th minutes. Irretrievable and severe brain damage starts after 10 minutes. Therefore CPR should be performed as soon as possible.

### What is a Brain Tumour?

The benign or malignant masses that originate from brain tissue cells, meninges, brain nerves or skull are broadly named as "brain tumours". Brain tumours may be congenital or occur in later phases of life. The brain tumour creates a mass effect which leads to an elevation of the intracranial pressure, and results in problems of the nervous system.

### What is Facial Paralysis?

The facial movements are controlled by the nerves that originate from the brain and reach our facial muscles (facial nerves) and the branches of nerve endings. Any disruption in this electrical network that starts in the brain and extends to the smallest muscles in the face results in the condition which is known as "facial paralysis". In most of the cases, the cause of the condition is unknown; however, there is a high probability of success in treatment.

### What is Lumbar Disc Herniation?

The spinal cord stretches along our spine and helps our organs function and our muscles work with nerve roots that shoot on the left and right of the spine at each level. The cartilage tissue between the vertebrae may wear out in time due to age, personal habits and occupational damage. The condition in which the cartilage tissue moves out of its place towards the spinal cord and nerve roots or gets dislocated and presses the nerve roots is called a hernia.

## Eye Health

### What is presbyopia?

Many people lose their ability to focus on nearby objects in their 40s, and may need glasses. This is commonly known as "presbyopia". This condition occurs because the lens of our eye loses its flexibility as we age.

### What is hypermetropia (far-sightedness)?

It is a visual condition in which you cannot see objects near you clearly because the front-to-back radius of the eye is shorter than normal size.

### What is myopia (short-sightedness)?

It is a common vision condition in which you cannot see the objects farther away clearly because your eyeball is too long. Individuals with myopia may squint their eyes to get a clear vision, which may cause headache. Severity of short-sightedness typically increases until 18 years of age.

### What is astigmatism?

It is a congenital imperfection of the top transparent layer (cornea) of the eye. Normally, the cornea is perfectly shaped like a round orange, but in some individuals, it may be elliptical like an egg, which causes astigmatism. Astigmatic individuals may see objects blurry and wavy.

## Respiratory Health

### What is asthma?

Asthma is a chronic disease of the lung, in which airways are narrowed. It may occur as attacks. The cause of the narrowing of the airways is the swelling of the walls of the airway due to a non-microbial reaction. The disease may occur as repeated shortness of breath, wheezing/whistling sound when breathing, feeling of pressure on the chest and coughing.

### What is dyspnea?

Dyspnea is a feeling of not being able to breathe well. Also known as shortness of breath, it is a very common symptom that can be associated with disorders in 3 organ systems: respiratory system, cardiovascular system and circulation system.

### What is COPD?

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) describes a group of lung conditions which make it difficult to empty air out of the lungs. The two chronic conditions that cause this problem are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. As a result, incoming air cannot reach the alveoli and is trapped in the lungs.

## Dental Health

### How to avoid bad breath?

You should brush your teeth at least for two minutes twice a day or after each meal. Many people think brushing the teeth is enough; however, there are a few more important steps:
- Brush your tongue as well, since bacteria and food particles hide under a thin layer there
- Flossing is very important to clean the areas between the teeth
- Remove food particles that are stuck between your teeth

### What is a dental cavity?

Dental cavities often occur after the destruction of the hard enamel tissue on the teeth, or of the underlying dentine tissue or of the hard tissue covering the dental root surface. This particularly happens when the dental surface comes into prolonged contact with carbohydrates (sugar, starch, etc.), soda or other fizzy beverages, cake, chocolate and other sticky food substances. The bacteria in the oral cavity feed on these food residues and produce acid which destroys the hard dental tissue.

## Infectious Diseases

### What is sepsis?

A severe infection in any part of the body may trigger an overreaction by the immune system, which may result in organ or tissue damage. This serious setting which may lead to single or multiple organ failure or even death is known as "sepsis" or "septicemia". Sepsis is a life-threatening condition and early diagnosis is vital for survival.
