# COVID-19 FAQs

Common questions about COVID-19, its transmission, symptoms, prevention, and vaccines.

---

## Transmission & Spread

### How does the virus spread?

SARS-CoV-2 is mainly spread via respiratory droplets, including aerosols, from an infected person who sneezes, coughs, speaks, sings or breathes in close proximity to other people. Droplets can be inhaled or deposited in the nose and mouth or on the eyes.

More rarely, infection may be due to contact with surfaces contaminated with droplets. The virus can survive on some surfaces for a few hours (copper, cardboard) and on others for up to a number of days (plastic and stainless steel). However, the amount of viable virus declines over time and it is rarely present on surfaces in sufficient amounts to cause infection.

An infected person can transmit the virus up to two days before they experience symptoms, as well as while they have symptoms or even if they do not show any symptoms.

### When is a person infectious?

SARS-CoV-2 can be detected 1 to 3 days before symptoms begin. However, detection of the virus does not necessarily mean that a person is infectious and able to spread the virus to others.

Evidence indicates that people become infectious around 48 hours before symptoms start, but are most infectious when experiencing symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild and non-specific.

Available data indicate that adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptoms begin. Most adults with severe to critical illness or severe immunosuppression may remain infectious for up to 20 days after symptoms begin.

Evidence shows that fully vaccinated individuals who become sick with COVID-19 can carry comparable amounts of virus as non-vaccinated people. However, vaccinated individuals have generally been found to be less infectious overall.

### Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who carries the virus. Many people with COVID-19 experience mild symptoms. This is particularly true in the early stages of the disease. It is possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.

### Can children or adolescents catch COVID-19?

Children and adolescents are just as likely to become infected as any other age group and can spread the disease. Evidence to date suggests that children and young adults are less likely to experience severe symptoms, but severe cases do exist in these age groups in case of underlying diseases or immune system problems.

### How long does it take after exposure to COVID-19 to develop symptoms?

The time between exposure to the new coronavirus and the onset of symptoms is commonly around two to five days but can range from 1–14 days. Please remember that some people may not show any symptoms.

## Symptoms & Severity

### What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are cold or flu-like symptoms and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include:
- Aches and pains
- Headache
- Conjunctivitis
- Sore throat
- Diarrhea
- Loss of taste or smell
- A rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes

Some people do not have symptoms although they carry the virus and can infect others. Most diagnosed people recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment, but some people become seriously ill and need hospitalization.

### How severe is the COVID-19 Infection?

Some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and most will recover without requiring special treatment. COVID-19 can sometimes be a severe disease requiring intensive care and potentially leading to death, especially among unvaccinated people, elderly, people with chronic diseases or immune system problems.

### What are the organs most affected by COVID-19?

It's mostly the respiratory system that is affected by COVID-19, however, other parts of the body may also be affected by the disease.

### Who is at higher risk of developing moderate to serious disease from COVID-19?

Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like:
- Cardiovascular diseases
- Diabetes
- Chronic respiratory diseases
- Obesity
- Kidney diseases
- Cancer
- Immune system problems

are more likely to develop moderate to serious disease.

## Prevention & Safety

### What should I do if I have come in close contact with someone who has COVID-19?

If you have been in close contact with someone infected with the new coronavirus, you may be infected. Close contact means that you live with or have been in settings of less than 2 meters from those who have the infection.

If testing is available, you can contact your health care provider to know if you can be tested. If you have a chronic disease or if you have moderate to severe symptoms, you should seek medical advice.

### What actions need to be taken to self-isolate?

Self-isolation is an important measure to reduce the spread of COVID-19. It requires that a person who is diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay at home and away from work, school or public places.

If possible, people should self-isolate in a well-ventilated room or area where other people are not present and where they have access to hand hygiene and toilet facilities. If this is not possible, self-isolating individuals should wear a mask and maintain at least a 2 meter distance from others.

### Should I avoid traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Travel increases your exposure to other people and it can be difficult to maintain enough physical distance while traveling on an airplane, bus, or train. If you must travel:
- Make sure you wash/sanitize your hands
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth
- Keep distance from others if possible
- Wear a mask or other face covering in public transport
- If traveling to other countries, make sure you know about COVID-related requirements and the healthcare system in that country

### How to grocery shop safely?

When grocery shopping, keep your distance from others and avoid touching your eyes, mouth or nose. Once home, wash your hands thoroughly. There are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 that have been transmitted through food.

### How to wash fruits and vegetables?

Fruits and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet. Wash them thoroughly with clean water, the same way you would under any circumstance.

## Treatment

### Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?

No. COVID-19 is caused by a virus and antibiotics do not work against viruses; they work against bacterial infections. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19.

Physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in moderate to severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.

## Vaccines

### What are the common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?

Some people do not experience any side effects, but the most commonly-reported events with COVID-19 vaccines are:
- Pain at the site of injection
- Headache
- Fatigue
- Muscle and joint pain
- Fever and chills

### Do I need a COVID-19 vaccine booster?

The protection COVID-19 vaccines provide decreases over time, especially for certain groups of people. Recent data suggest their effectiveness at preventing infection or severe disease wanes over time, especially in people older than 65 years old and people with immune system problems.

The emergence of the variants emphasizes the importance of vaccination and boosters for at-risk groups, especially older people and people living with a chronic disease.
