## Therapy & Treatment

### How will talking to a therapist change my situation?

We can share a lot of things with the people we trust in our daily lives and support each other. The difference of speaking in the therapy setting is that it aims to gain awareness, develop coping skills, and transform by exploring the situation you are having trouble with.

The process takes place under the guidance of a professional in a manner that is:
- Impartial
- Open and sincere
- Adhered to ethical rules
- Without judgment or advice

A supportive relationship based on trust, confidentiality and unconditional acceptance is established between the therapist and the client.

### Is drug-free treatment possible?

Drug-free treatment of psychological disorders is possible, but when determining treatment, it is decided by evaluating:
- The specific situation
- The severity of the disorder
- How much it affects the life of the person

**Treatment approaches:**
- In some disorders, drug forms the main method of treatment
- In some disorders, a combination of psychotherapy and drug therapy is used
- Only psychotherapy can be preferred at the beginning of the disorder and during the period when complaints are low

**Supporting factors:** Physical activity, healthy and balanced nutrition, adequate sleep, and strong social relationships are important. It is known that medication has an effective and accelerating effect on the healing process.

### I started to feel better after I started medication. Can I stop taking the medicine?

For many people, stopping taking medication means 'getting well'. When you start to feel good about yourself, you may feel the urge to stop taking the drug.

**Important:** Even after your symptoms that bother you improve, you may need to continue using the drug for preventive purposes. It is best to decide when to stop taking the drug with the doctor following your situation.

### Are antidepressant drugs addictive?

Antidepressants do not cause physical dependence. Sudden discontinuation of the drug after long-term use may cause certain withdrawal symptoms, but this does not mean that you are addicted to antidepressants.

**Important:** Do not start medication or stop treatment on your own without consulting a doctor. Always discuss any potential concerns with your doctor.

## Coping with Stress

### What can I do in stressful moments?

Stress is a unique experience of life in everyday life. Feeling stressed is not an abnormal condition.

**Steps to cope with stress:**
1. **Identify stress** - Notice what is happening in your body (hands sweating, heart beating rapidly, difficulty recovering thoughts)
2. **Confront the situation** - Express it in a few sentences, even writing down these thoughts
3. **Identify your emotions**
4. **Learn more** - Talk to someone who has been through this before or do research
5. **Examine the situation** - Consider the positive, negative, and neutral aspects
6. **Take action** - Decide how to act, talk to friends, take deep breaths

## Supporting Others

### I'm worried about the mental health of someone I know (family, friends). What should I do?

It depends on your relationship with the person you are dealing with, the depth of your relationship.

**Things you can do:**
- Being there for them
- Listening to their concerns without interrupting them and trying to change their minds
- Understanding them
- Encouraging them to get support
- Creating action plans together if they want to

### How to approach people who do not accept treatment?

In the process of psychological assistance, one's own will is quite important. This directly affects the efficiency that a person will receive from the help process.

**Steps:**
1. **Listen very well** - This is the priority
2. **Understand their concerns and desires** - This is the second step
3. **Provide information and encourage** - Make plans together as a third step

**Important:** If you approach with a coercive, oppressive, convincing attitude, this may cause the person to close themselves even more. A more effective approach is to listen well, understand them, and speak without judgment.
