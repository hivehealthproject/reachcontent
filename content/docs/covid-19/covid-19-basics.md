# Basic Info About COVID-19 and Prevention

## Overview

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in December 2019 and has since spread globally. Understanding how the virus spreads and how to protect yourself is essential for staying healthy.

---

## How the Virus Spreads

SARS-CoV-2 is mainly spread via respiratory droplets, including aerosols, from an infected person who:
- Sneezes
- Coughs
- Speaks
- Sings
- Breathes in close proximity to others

Droplets can be inhaled or deposited in the nose, mouth, or eyes. More rarely, infection may be due to contact with surfaces contaminated with droplets.

The virus can survive on some surfaces:
- Copper, cardboard: A few hours
- Plastic and stainless steel: Up to a number of days

However, the amount of viable virus declines over time and is rarely present on surfaces in sufficient amounts to cause infection.

**Important:** An infected person can transmit the virus up to two days before they experience symptoms, while they have symptoms, or even if they do not show any symptoms.

---

## Symptoms

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:
- Cold or flu-like symptoms
- Tiredness/fatigue

Other symptoms that are less common include:
- Aches and pains
- Headache
- Conjunctivitis (pink eye)
- Sore throat
- Diarrhea
- Loss of taste or smell
- Rash on skin
- Discoloration of fingers or toes

**Note:** Some people do not have symptoms although they carry the virus and can infect others.

## Disease Severity

Some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and most will recover without requiring special treatment.

COVID-19 can sometimes be a severe disease requiring intensive care and potentially leading to death, especially among:
- Unvaccinated people
- Elderly
- People with chronic diseases
- People with immune system problems

---

## Who is at Higher Risk?

People more likely to develop moderate to serious disease include:
- Older people
- Those with underlying medical problems:
  - Cardiovascular diseases
  - Diabetes
  - Chronic respiratory diseases
  - Obesity
  - Kidney diseases
  - Cancer
  - Immune system problems

## Prevention Measures

### Personal Protection
- **Wash hands frequently**: With soap and water for at least 20 seconds
- **Use hand sanitizer**: When soap and water are not available
- **Wear a mask**: In crowded or indoor public spaces
- **Maintain physical distance**: At least 2 meters from others
- **Avoid touching face**: Eyes, nose, and mouth
- **Get vaccinated**: Vaccines are safe and effective

### When Sick
- **Stay home**: If you feel unwell
- **Self-isolate**: If diagnosed with COVID-19
- **Seek medical care**: If symptoms are severe

---

## Self-Isolation

Self-isolation is an important measure to reduce the spread of COVID-19. It requires that a person who is diagnosed with COVID-19:
- Stay at home
- Stay away from work, school, or public places
- If possible, stay in a well-ventilated room where others are not present
- Have access to hand hygiene and toilet facilities
- If isolation is not possible, wear a mask and maintain at least 2 meters distance from others

## FAQs

### How does the virus spread?

SARS-CoV-2 is mainly spread via respiratory droplets from an infected person who sneezes, coughs, speaks, sings or breathes in close proximity to other people. Droplets can be inhaled or deposited in the nose and mouth or on the eyes. More rarely, infection may be due to contact with contaminated surfaces. An infected person can transmit the virus up to two days before they experience symptoms.

### When is a person infectious?

SARS-CoV-2 can be detected 1 to 3 days before symptoms begin. People become infectious around 48 hours before symptoms start, but are most infectious when experiencing symptoms. Most adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptoms begin. Those with severe illness or immunosuppression may remain infectious for up to 20 days.

### How severe is the COVID-19 Infection?

Some people infected will experience mild to moderate symptoms and most will recover without requiring special treatment. COVID-19 can sometimes be severe, requiring intensive care and potentially leading to death, especially among unvaccinated people, elderly, people with chronic diseases or immune system problems.

### What are the organs most affected by COVID-19?

It's mostly the respiratory system that is affected by COVID-19, however, other parts of the body may also be affected by the disease.

### Can children or adolescents catch COVID-19?

Children and adolescents are just as likely to become infected as any other age group and can spread the disease. Evidence suggests they are less likely to experience severe symptoms, but severe cases do exist in these age groups, particularly with underlying diseases or immune system problems.

### How long does it take after exposure to develop symptoms?

The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is commonly around two to five days but can range from 1 to 14 days. Some people may not show any symptoms.

### Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

Yes. Many people with COVID-19 experience mild symptoms, especially in the early stages. It is possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.

### What should I do if I have come in close contact with someone who has COVID-19?

If you have been in close contact with someone infected (within 2 meters), you may be infected. If testing is available, contact your health care provider. If you have a chronic disease or moderate to severe symptoms, seek medical advice.

### Are antibiotics effective against COVID-19?

No. COVID-19 is caused by a virus and antibiotics do not work against viruses. Antibiotics should not be used as prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Physicians may sometimes use antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections that can be a complication in moderate to severely ill patients.

### Do I need a COVID-19 vaccine booster?

The protection COVID-19 vaccines provide decreases over time, especially for certain groups. Recent data suggest effectiveness at preventing infection or severe disease wanes over time, especially in people older than 65 and people with immune system problems. The emergence of variants emphasizes the importance of vaccination and boosters for at-risk groups.

### What are the common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?

Some people do not experience any side effects, but the most commonly-reported events include:
- Pain at the site of injection
- Headache
- Fatigue
- Muscle and joint pain
- Fever and chills
