# Healthcare System in Turkey

## Overview

The healthcare system of Turkey is governed by the Ministry of Health of Turkey. Universal health care is provided through a government health insurance system. Citizens and residents are insured under a program administered by the Social Security Institution.

Turkey has a universal healthcare system known as General Health Insurance (Genel Saglik Sigortasi), through which the state covers basic medical expenses for all citizens.

The Ministry of Health has the mandate for controlling all health services in the country. The Ministry also runs many health facilities including university medical centers, hospitals, and healthcare centers.

The Turkish healthcare system has primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare institutions.

### Primary Healthcare

Primary healthcare services are provided at Family Health Centers, Village Health Rooms, and Community Health Centers. Services at this level include vaccinations, maternal and child health care, and health promotion activities.

### Secondary Healthcare

Secondary healthcare services are offered at district and public hospitals.

### Tertiary Healthcare

Tertiary healthcare services are offered at training and research hospitals, university hospitals, and the large private hospitals that are capable of offering healthcare services at the highest standards.

## FAQs

### What Is Migrant Health Center?

Migrant Health Centers (GSM) are established under community health centers at locations with higher migrant populations to offer preventive healthcare services to forced migrants in a more effective and efficient way, to overcome the problems arising from language barrier and to improve access to healthcare services.

Enhanced GSMs are established in temporary accommodation centers that are away from a fully-equipped public hospital or in residential areas with a migrant population over 20,000 people. In addition to primary healthcare services, enhanced GSMs offer services in internal medicine, pediatric care, obstetrics-gynecology, oral and dental health, and psychosocial support services, which are also supported by imaging units and basic service laboratories. The aim is to improve access to services and reduce the workload of hospitals.

### What Is The Guest Patient System?

Individuals who will be away from their permanent residence address or who will temporarily live in Turkey can access healthcare services from the nearest family physician under the guest patient system. When a person needs to access healthcare services at a different location than their permanent address during summer holidays, travels or for any other reason, these services can be offered by a family physician in that city as a "guest patient". The districts governed by the Law on Metropolitan Municipalities are considered as a single region in the implementation of the guest patient system. In this region, healthcare services cannot be offered under the guest patient system. Individuals in this region are asked to first consult their own family physician except for emergency situations.
