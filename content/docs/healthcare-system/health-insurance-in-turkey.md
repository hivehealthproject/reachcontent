## FAQs

### We have to pay additional fees at hospitals even if we have coverage by Social Security Institution. How do the additional fees work?

According to the Law on Social Insurance and General Health Insurance, additional fees are charged by foundation hospitals that have contracts with the Social Security Institution and private healthcare service providers. When persons who have coverage from general health insurance (GSS) are admitted to these hospitals, they may be charged up to twice the amount of normal service fees listed in Health Application Communique (SUT) and its attachments.

Private healthcare service providers are obliged to put up signs explaining the additional fee percentages in a visible location and inform citizens about additional fees. They also have to get written consent from patients and their relatives for additional fees before actually offering healthcare services. Without such consent, the service provider cannot claim additional fees for any reason after the services are actually offered.

### Can persons who have coverage from Social Security Institution be admitted to all hospitals?

Social Security Institution (SGK) executes contracts/protocols with healthcare service providers. Thus, the healthcare services offered by providers are renumerated by SGK. Individuals who have coverage from general health insurance (GSS) must be admitted to healthcare service providers who have executed contracts/protocols with SSI. They can be admitted to healthcare service providers that do not have contracts with SSI only in emergency situations which are described in legislation. It must be confirmed by audit teams that the patient has really been admitted for an emergency.
