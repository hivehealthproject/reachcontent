# Mental Health Promotion

## Overview

Mental health promotion involves actions to create living conditions and environments that support mental health and allow people to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles. It includes creating an environment that respects and protects basic civil, political, socio-economic and cultural rights.

Mental health is just like physical health. It is important for everyone! Just like our body, our minds can get sick, tired, or weak. And just like our body, it is possible to strengthen our minds.

The state of our mental health affects how we think, feel and act. It helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.

## Maintaining Mental Health

The answers to the questions of what life is like for us and how we see ourselves in this place will help us to understand our expectations of life. We think our mental health will be stronger as these expectations are met. However, basically we can say that every person wants to be happy and healthy.

Protective factors for mental health include:
- Having a healthy family life
- Having social relationships and romantic relationships that we enjoy
- Having life goals that lift us out of bed every day and motivate us to do things
- Having a healthy body
- Being able to eat and sleep regularly
- Having hobbies and habits that are good for us (playing sports, reading books, playing an instrument)
- Working and producing

## Dealing with Stress

Stress is a unique experience of life in everyday life. Feeling stressed is not an abnormal condition. Of course we can feel stress before important events for us, but what is important here is how stress affects the quality of our lives. Therefore, after feeling stressed, what we do becomes important.

### Recognizing Stress

There may be moments in the course of daily life when we don't realize we're stressed. That is why the priority is to identify stress itself. What happens when we feel stressed?
- Our hands may sweat
- Our hearts may beat rapidly
- We may have difficulty recovering our thoughts

### Coping with Stress

Steps to manage stress:
1. Confront the situation that you consider stressful
2. Express this situation in a few sentences, even write down these thoughts
3. Identify the emotions you feel
4. Learn more about the situation (talk to someone who has been through it before, do research)
5. Examine the positive-negative-neutral aspects of the situation
6. Decide how to act
7. Talk to friends
8. Take deep breaths
