# Panic Disorder

## Overview

Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks - sudden periods of intense fear that come on quickly and reach their peak within minutes. These attacks can occur unexpectedly or can be brought on by a trigger, such as a feared object or situation.

Panic disorder is actually more common in children and adolescents than many realize. Children may not always know how to talk about the anxiety or fear they are experiencing and may not be fully aware of the reasons their panic attacks started.
