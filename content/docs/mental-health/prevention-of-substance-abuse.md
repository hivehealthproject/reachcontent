# Prevention of Substance Abuse

## Overview

Substance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs. Use of these substances can lead to dependence syndrome - a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use.

It can be defined as being attached to a certain action, a certain object or person and thinking that one cannot do without it. Addiction can manifest itself as a constant desire to do that action, not being able to stop unless you can do it, and even a constant (increasingly) desire to do more.

## Risk Factors

Factors influencing substance use and abuse include:
- Family history of addiction
- Mental health disorders
- Peer pressure
- Lack of family involvement
- Early use of substances
- Taking highly addictive drugs

## Effects on the Brain

After repeated drug use, the brain starts to adjust to the surges of dopamine. Neurons may begin to reduce the number of dopamine receptors or simply make less dopamine. The result is less dopamine signaling in the brain - like turning down the volume on the dopamine signal.

This leads to:
- Needing more of the substance to feel the same effect (tolerance)
- Difficulty feeling pleasure from anything besides the drug
- Withdrawal symptoms when not using

## FAQs

### What is addiction?

It can be defined as being attached to a certain action, a certain object or person and thinking that one cannot do without it. Addiction can manifest itself as a constant desire to do that action, not being able to stop unless you can do it, and even a constant (increasingly) desire to do more. For example, a person who smokes 5 cigarettes a day starts to smoke more and more.

### How do I approach a loved one about their substance use?

If you think someone has a problem, it's important to approach that person in a non-confrontational way - at least at first. And it's always a good idea to get the advice of a qualified professional counselor before talking with someone about their substance use.

When discussing the problem, it's important to be calm. Express your concern without name-calling, blaming, or accusing. Simply say that you care about them and have noticed that their use is affecting their life. Say that you would like them to see if they can stop their use on their own. If they can't, ask them to consider getting professional help.

It is normal for those who abuse alcohol or drugs to react angrily when they are approached - even when it's done in a gentle, caring manner. Arguing with them or becoming angry and lashing out at them will cause them to focus on that instead of their own use.

### How do I know if I am addicted to alcohol or drugs?

It isn't always easy to know if you are dependent on alcohol or drugs. In fact, many people don't believe they're addicted even after it's clear to those around them. Addiction is a combination of factors, and only a trained counselor can determine if someone is alcohol- or drug-dependent.

Addiction counselors look for a pattern of behaviors that includes:
- Negative consequences of alcohol or drug use
- An inability to quit or control alcohol or drug use
- Increasing amounts and/or frequency of use

### My friend smokes all the time and I am very uncomfortable. What can I do?

If your friend is constantly smoking, you may be worried and especially if he smokes around you, it may cause you to be affected by smoke and smell. In such a situation, expressing your discomfort and staying away from the smoking environment, if possible, can be considered as a good choice for your health. If your friend wants to quit smoking, you can direct and support your friend to appropriate resources and hotlines.

### I don't smoke, but I do smoke hookah. What can I do?

Hookah is a tobacco product that is at least as harmful as cigarettes. You can get support from institutions working with addiction, such as the Ministry of Health and the Green Crescent, in quitting the hookah habit.

### When my friends offer cigarettes, I cannot refuse, but I am uncomfortable with it. What can I do?

You realize that smoking harms you. In this case, you don't have to do anything that harms you. It's a natural reaction to say no to your friends about it, that you don't want to use it, and it's your right to say it. Setting boundaries is important for your health.
