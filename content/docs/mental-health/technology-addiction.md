# Technology Addiction

## Overview

Technology addiction, also known as internet addiction or digital addiction, refers to the excessive use of technology to the point where it interferes with daily life. This can include overuse of smartphones, computers, video games, social media, or the internet in general.

### My child/brother is always at the computer. I think they're showing signs of technology addiction. What can I do?
