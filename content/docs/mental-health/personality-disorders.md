# Personality Disorders

## Overview

Personality disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by inflexible and unhealthy patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. These patterns deviate from cultural expectations and cause significant distress or problems in relationships, work, and daily functioning.

People with personality disorders have difficulty perceiving and relating to situations and people. This causes significant problems and limitations in relationships, social activities, work, and school.

### I think my friend may have a personality disorder. He doesn't want any help. What can I do?

Volunteering is important in mental health counseling, no matter who it is. A person can feel even worse when they're taken somewhere as if they were being forced to do something they don't want. This can also damage the relationship of trust with the people around him.

In this case, if there is a person who you think should get counseling, a relative, especially the person who gets along with him and listens to him, can be consulted together after gaining his trust by saying that this process can be healthy for him, that it will be good for him, that no harm will come to him, that he will be with him every step of the way.

If someone is in danger of harm, you can get support from psychiatric emergency room.

### How can I support someone with a personality disorder?

- Educate yourself about the specific disorder
- Set healthy boundaries while being supportive
- Be patient and consistent
- Avoid judgment and criticism
- Encourage treatment
- Take care of your own mental health
- Seek support for yourself if needed
