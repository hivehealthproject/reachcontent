# Depression

## Overview

Depression is a common but serious mood disorder that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. It causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.

Depression is different from regular sadness or grief. While it's normal to feel sad sometimes, depression persists and interferes with daily life.

## FAQs

### How is depression diagnosed and treated?

The first step to being diagnosed is to visit a doctor for a medical evaluation. Certain medications, and some medical conditions such as thyroid disorder, can cause similar symptoms as depression. A doctor can rule out these possibilities by conducting a physical examination, interview and lab tests. If the doctor eliminates a medical condition as a cause, he or she can implement treatment or refer the person to a mental health professional.

Once diagnosed, a person with depression can be treated by various methods. The mainstays of treatment for depression are any of a number of antidepressant medications and psychotherapy, which can also be used in combination.

### Why is depression more prevalent among women than among men?

Depression is twice as common among women as among men. About 20 percent of women experience at least one episode of depression across their lifetime. Scientists are examining many potential causes for and contributing factors to women's increased risk for depression. Biological, life cycle, hormonal and psychosocial factors unique to women may be linked to women's higher depression rates. Researchers have shown, for example, that hormones affect brain chemistry, impacting emotions and mood.

### Are antidepressant drugs addictive?

Antidepressants do not cause physical dependence. Sudden discontinuation of the drug after long-term use may cause certain withdrawal symptoms, but this does not mean that you are addicted to antidepressants. Do not start medication or stop treatment on your own without consulting a doctor. Always discuss any potential concerns with your doctor.

### I started to feel better after I started medication. Can I stop taking the medicine?

For many people, stopping taking medication means 'getting well'. When you start to feel good about yourself, you may feel the urge to stop taking the drug. Even after your symptoms that bother you improve, you may need to continue using the drug for preventive purposes. It is best to decide when to stop taking the drug with the doctor following your situation.

### How will talking to a therapist change my situation?

We can share a lot of things with the people we trust in our daily lives and support each other. The difference of speaking in the therapy setting is that it aims to gain awareness, develop coping skills, and transform by exploring the situation you are having trouble with. The process takes place under the guidance of a professional in a manner that is impartial, open, sincere and adhered to ethical rules without judgment or advice. A supportive relationship based on trust, confidentiality and unconditional acceptance is established between the therapist and the client.

### Is depression a personality problem or weakness?

Although many people realize that they are depressed, they see it as their own weakness and may feel embarrassed to share it with others and seek help. However, depression is not a condition caused by a person's weakness, willpower or self-induced condition. Depression is a condition that occurs as a result of the effects that predispose the person, affecting hormones and the functioning of the brain. When you are depressed, you may not know why, you may not understand how you became like this. Getting professional support can help you make sense of the process and get better.
