# Anxiety Disorders

## Overview

Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health conditions. While occasional anxiety is a normal part of life, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.

Anxiety disorders involve more than temporary worry or fear. For a person with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, school work, and relationships.

## FAQs

### How can I tell the difference between Normal Anxiety and Anxiety Disorder?

Anxiety that does not affect the work you do in your daily life can be considered natural and normal. However, excessive anxiety, intense and frequent occurrence, persistence for a long time (more than 6 months), and being unable to do the things you do in your daily life can be considered as signs of an anxiety disorder. In such a situation, you can consult a mental health professional.

### Will my anxiety go away on its own?

It is normal to feel anxious before and during important events in our lives. Since these events have passed, we can expect the worries to pass. However, when this situation starts to become permanent and affects your daily life, getting support from a mental health professional will make you very comfortable. You don't have to fight alone.

### Is my anxiety normal?

We all worry from time to time. It is normal to feel anxious. Before a job we will do, before an exam we will take, when we have health problems, when our financial situation is not sufficient, or when we think that it will not be enough, we may feel anxiety in our relationships with our family and those around us. Such anxieties enable us to prepare and take action so that we can deal with our daily problems.

However, the important point here is the intensity and level of the anxiety we feel. If you feel unable to cope and your worries are affecting your daily life, it would be good to seek support from a mental health professional.

### I constantly feel anxious. What can I do?

How long has this situation been going on? You can do many things to calm down, such as breathing, meditating, doing your hobbies, doing sports, talking to your friends, but the relief they create for you may also be temporary. We recommend that you seek professional support for a permanent solution.

### My friend says he always feels uneasy. What can I do?

Listen to what your friend is thinking and feeling. It's not always easy to talk about situations that cause us distress. The more he feels that you are listening to him with interest, the more he may feel comfortable opening himself up. Then you can ask what you can do to support him and you can play an important role in getting professional support by collaborating with your friend.
