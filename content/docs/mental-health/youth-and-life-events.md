## Psychological Resilience

Psychological resilience refers to adaptability in its simplest form. We can experience difficult life events and stressful situations in our everyday life. Even if the situation is the same, the way people are affected and their level may be different.

Psychological resilience ensures that you can be minimally affected by negative effects and maintain a state of well-being. It may have developed due to factors such as a unique, innate predisposition, family support, social environment, etc.

The good news is that psychological resilience is also a personality trait that can be learned and improved.

### Building Resilience

Factors that increase psychological resilience:
- Having a strong social support system (people who support you financially and spiritually, who you enjoy spending time with)
- Gaining healthy thinking habits
- Taking care of self-care (regular sleep, eating well, exercise, etc.)
- A mental health professional can help you improve your psychological resilience

## Motivation

Do you ever feel reluctant or lazy to get things done? Maybe you still haven't started the things you've been wanting to do for a long time? If so, you may be experiencing a lack of motivation.

Motivation is a feeling that drives us to do things, to take action to achieve our goals.

### Types of Motivation

**Intrinsic Motivation:** Internal and related to emotions, such as wanting to perform well because it makes you feel self-confident and happy.

**Extrinsic Motivation:** Connected to external events, such as working to get a high grade or seeking appreciation from others.

### Building Motivation

- **Pair:** Match something you don't like to do with something you love to do. For example, listen to music while folding clothes.
- **Reward yourself:** Give yourself a reward after completing tasks you don't enjoy.
- **Turn it into a habit:** The more you repeat something, the more likely it will turn into a habit and become easier.
- **Start small:** Divide overwhelming tasks into smaller, manageable parts.
