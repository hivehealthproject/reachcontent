# Psychotic Disorders

## Overview

Psychotic disorders are severe mental disorders that cause abnormal thinking and perceptions. People with psychotic disorders lose touch with reality. The main symptoms include delusions (false beliefs) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there).

Psychosis has no typical beginning. Some begin in an acute, rather flaming way, while others can manifest themselves with a more insidious and mild start. However, whether it starts acutely or begins with fainter and milder symptoms, there may usually be some faint, signaling symptoms that people experience in the years before their first attack.
