# Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

## Overview

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Such events may include natural disasters, serious accidents, war/conflict, sexual assault, or other life-threatening situations.

It is completely normal to feel afraid and worried after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. With your body fully alert and trying to defend you against harm, as well as strong emotions that may come up including guilt, anger, and sadness, it is natural to have some symptoms after the event is over. However, most people recover from initial symptoms within one month. People with PTSD feel they are in danger and experience symptoms even when they are in a safe environment, for a longer period of time.

### Avoidance
- Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event

## PTSD in Children

Children and teenagers can also have PTSD and have strong reactions to a traumatic event. However, they may exhibit some different symptoms.

**Teenagers and older children** may present with symptoms similarly to adults. They may also:
- Be disruptive, defensive, or disrespectful
- Start engaging in destructive behaviors
- Have thoughts of revenge
- Feel guilt for not being able to prevent an injury or death

**Younger children** may show:
- Repetitive play with themes or aspects of the traumatic event
- Nightmares (possibly without clear recognizable content)
- Wetting the bed after having learned to use the toilet
- Not being able to or not wanting to talk (selective mutism)
- Acting out the scary events through play
- Being unusually clingy to a parent/caregiver

- **Prolonged Exposure Therapy**: Gradually approaching trauma-related memories and situations
- **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)**: Uses guided eye movements while recalling the trauma

### Medication
- Antidepressants can help control symptoms
- Anti-anxiety medications may provide short-term relief

### Self-Care

- Follow your treatment plan
- Practice stress management
- Take care of your physical health
- Connect with others who understand

## FAQs

### How long does Post Traumatic Stress Disorder last?

In the first days after experiencing a traumatic event, feelings of fear, nightmares, and feeling bad are more common. However, these symptoms may persist for days or weeks. But Post Traumatic Stress Disorder isn't something you have to live with for life. If you get professional support, these symptoms will ease and pass.

### Where should I go to be treated for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?

Hospitals with psychiatry and psychologist services, non-governmental organizations working with trauma, psychological counseling units if you are at school or university will provide you with the necessary support and guidance.

### Is it PTSD or just a short-term reaction?

It is completely normal to feel afraid and worried after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Most people recover from initial symptoms within one month of their onset. People with PTSD feel they are in danger and experience symptoms even when they are in a safe environment, for a longer period of time. If you believe you may have PTSD, take an appointment with a mental health professional.

### Do children and adults react to PTSD the same way?

Children and teenagers can also have PTSD and have strong reactions to a traumatic event. However, they may exhibit some different symptoms. Teenagers may be disruptive or engage in destructive behaviors. Younger children may show symptoms through repetitive play, nightmares, bed-wetting, or being unusually clingy.

### How can I support someone with PTSD?

Seeing a person you care about struggle with PTSD is not easy. A large part of supporting them is listening to them without judgment or advice and letting them share as much or as little as they feel safe to, without pushing. Letting them know you are happy to listen will open up the conversation.

More generally:
- Encourage healthy living (exercise, refraining from smoking or alcohol use)
- Plan activities that they may feel comfortable doing and that would help them relax
- Remember to take care of your own physical and mental health
- Contact a counselor or therapist if you also need support
